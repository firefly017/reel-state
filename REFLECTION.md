What did you do well, process wise
What would you do differently next time to improve, process wise
->creating static routes, setting up navbar
->creating buttons, forms,
->handling the form data with useState hooks was a bit difficult

->learn dynamic routing carefully
->having trouble with setting up min and max values for slider
->in form component, I fetched the listing data again from API, which is coontradictory to DRY, next time I'll make data fetching more reusable.
->for the express server part, had confusion regarding hardcoding/fetching data from API(finally fetched data from API), could not make the fetched data look pretty.

//\* used a bit of advanced code for schedule viewing form from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-eBwLmXGo
//\* for now created some styling, AgentCard.css might need some changing after sorting the agents via languages
